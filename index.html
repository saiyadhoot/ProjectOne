        <h3>I am a second year college student attending San Francisco State University. I am double majoring in Interior Design and Visual Communication Design. I have a lemon-white beagle named Enzo, and he always likes to eat me and my familyâ€™s shoes. I was born in San Jose and have lived here since. Outside of class, I like to play videogames, watch a mix of anime and TV shows, or watch live sports on my laptop.
