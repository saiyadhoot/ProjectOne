        <h2>Introducing Saiya!</h2>
        <p> Saiya is a second-year student at San Francisco State University majoring in Interior Design and Visual Communication Design.
            She has always been interested in Interior Design from a young age, whether it involves playing home decorating games or just scrolling on Zillow for hours on end judging local home listings.
            She also has a passion for graphic design and illustration, which is why she decided to double major in Visual Communication Design.
            Her hopes for the future post-graduation are to work for a commercial design firm or as a set designer for a media company.
            She also hopes to relocate to somewhere like Los Angeles or San Diego, as she has always wanted to live in Southern California.
            <br></br>
            In her free time, she enjoys playing video games, watching anime, and listening to her many Spotify playlists as well as podcasts such as Rotten Mango and Moral of The Story.
            Games she likes to play include Honkai: Star Rail, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Splatoon 3. 
            Some shows she enjoys watching are One Piece, Kim's Convenience, and Dandadan.
            Music genres she enjoys include rap, pop, and R&B.
            <br></br>
            Spending time with her family and friends is also very important to her, as she enjoys going out to eat and trying new things.
            Outings that include going to Great America, watching a new movie, and even walking around the mall are some of her favorite things to do with her friends.
            She also loves visiting Monterey Bay Aquarium, with each experience being more memorable than the last.
            <br></br>
            In the context of web design, she hopes to learn more about the process of creating a website and how to make it more user-friendly.
            She also hopes to learn more about the different tools and techniques used in web design, as well as how to create a website that is both visually appealing and functional.
